Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and clean the provided dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the distribution of features, identify potential correlations, and gain insights into customer characteristics.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., combining income and co-applicant income, creating a debt-to-income ratio).
Model Building: Train and evaluate various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to predict loan eligibility.
Model Selection: Select the best-performing model based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Model Interpretation: Analyze feature importance to identify the most influential factors in loan eligibility.
